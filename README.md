The Changing Discourses on EU Accession and Pre-Acession Funds:
A Longitudinal Analysis of Serbian and Turkish Parliamentary Debates
### Objective
This study aimed to improve our understanding of how domestic politics influence views of the European Union and accession process in different national contexts, with a particular focus on the roles of political parties and pre-accession funds. By examining parliamentary minutes, the study tracked changes in discourse and attitudes towards the EU. Sentiment analysis is done through fine-tuned Turkish model and Serbian specialized Bert model.
